# NumGuesser
<h2>About</h2>
Random Number Guesser generates a random number and asks the user to guess what the number is. If the user’s guess is higher than the random number, the code should display Too high. If the user’s guess is lower than the random number, the code should display Too low and tell the user that wheather the gussed number is too close or far.

<h2>Rules</h2>
1. If the guessed number is bigger than the actual number, the code will respond with the message that the guessed number is higher than the actual number.</br>
2. If the guessed number is smaller than the actual number, the code will respond with the message that the guessed number is lower than the actual number.</br>
2. If the guessed number is equal to the actual number or if the K trials are exhausted, the code will end with a suitable message.</br>
